1) Pull down all of the texts + metadata from http://openn.library.upenn.edu/Data/0001/
We need to find a way to get this in a text format (I'm pretty sure they have a collection like this that is all transcribed but we might have to pay them for it).
We need to figure out how we want to store it (or not store it)
Will we need a script to do this?

Note that there is an already parsed english one https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/
We should also look for others in languages like latin, and other 1600-1800 languages.

2) Learn about https://engineering.fb.com/ai-research/laser-multilingual-sentence-embeddings/
And develop a strategy for mapping the above corpus into something usable by laser.

3) ??????????

I will attempt to refine these into more specific tasks and create a project board (will link here once I make it)
